# Clorox OneTrust "Your Privacy Choices" Integration

This code is to simplify the integration of the second OneTrust modal into WordPress and NextJS sites. It is published as an npm package to **GitHub Packages** under the scope `@electro-creative-workshop/electro-privacy`.

## Adding the dependency

There are two options.

1. **Legacy GitHub:** Pull from git directly. Add a line to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "electro-privacy": "github:electro-creative-workshop/electro-privacy#semver:^x.x.x"
   ```
   Replace `x.x.x` with the exact version desired. To update the version, edit `package.json` by hand.

   Load required JS & CSS from this package:
   - In `main.js`: `import 'electro-privacy'`
   - In `scss/decoration/index.scss`: `@use '../../../node_modules/electro-privacy/dist/electro-privacy';`

2. **npm (GitHub Packages):** Install the package from the GitHub npm registry. This gives you the published version and standard npm updates.
   ```bash
   npm install @electro-creative-workshop/electro-privacy
   ```
   You must be logged in to GitHub Packages (see below) and have access to the `@electro-creative-workshop` scope.

change your import from:

`import('electro-privacy').catch(err => {....`

to

`import('@electro-creative-workshop/electro-privacy').catch(err => {...`

You will probably need to reimport your css like so, but sites may vary. Be sure to do an `npm run build` to troubleshoot.

`@use '~@electro-creative-workshop/electro-privacy/dist/electro-privacy' as *;`

You may have to add a file in `types` called `electro-privacy.d.ts` that declares the module:

`declare module '@electro-creative-workshop/electro-privacy';`

In order to use Github's repo, you must generate a token that has read:packages in scope
[New Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
Then run the following command in the repository. You will be prompted for your
GitHub username, and a password, which is the token's value.

```bash
npm login --scope=@electro-creative-workshop --auth-type=legacy --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
On Vercel, you need to set up a `NPM_RC` environment variable like so:

    registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:\_authToken={your read-only token here}
    @electro-creative-workshop:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/

## WordPress Sites

1. Add this package as a project dependency in `package.json`



3. Add to the footer near the "Cookie Settings" button:

    - `<button id="do-not-share">Your Privacy Choices</button>`
    - Add the "opt out" icon here next to the text: https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/icons-download

4. In footer.scss, add the `#do-not-share` to the `#ot-sdk-btn` rule to style "Your Privacy Choices" button the same way as "Cookie Settings". For example:

    ```
    #ot-sdk-btn, #do-not-share {
     margin-bottom: 1em;
     padding: 0 !important;
     font-size: 1em !important;
     color: $color-white !important;
     border: none !important;
    }
    ```

## NextJS sites:

### Your NextJS site may differ slightly, but this is the general flavor of the changes

1. Add this package as a project dependency in `package.json`

2. in `src/pages/\_app.js`

    - `import { useEffect } from 'react'`
    - in `export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {` or something similar, add: - `useEffect(() => { import('electro-privacy'); }, [])`

3. in `src/styles/global.scss`

    - `@import '../../node_modules/electro-privacy/dist/electro-privacy';`

4. Add near the "Cookie Settings" button:

```
    <button id="do-not-share">
```

5. Add `#do-not-share` to the existing `#ot-sdk-btn` rule to style the "Do Not Share..." text:

```
#ot-sdk-btn,
#do-not-share {
  background: none !important;
  border: none !important;
  color: #133d8d !important;
```

## Token Configuration

The OneTrust tokens are hardcoded in the module. The module automatically uses the appropriate token (production or staging) based on the environment detection. No configuration is required.

## UAT Values

The current production version sends entries to the live OneTrust collection point by default. If you need to support UAT, set this variable before importing electro-privacy:

`window.electroPrivacyStaging = true;`

This will change the following values to the non-production values:

-   url
-   token (hardcoded staging token)
-   ID

Alternatively, the module automatically detects non-production environments based on the hostname (e.g., `vercel.app`, `staging`, `dev`, `qa`, `local`, `lndo.site`, `pantheonsite`).

## Debug logging

To log the API URL and environment (production vs staging) to the browser console when submitting, set this before loading electro-privacy:

`window.electroPrivacyDebug = true;`

The request body (email, token) is never logged to avoid PII and token leakage. Debug logging is off by default.

## Language Support

The default implementation supports English & Spanish based on the lang attribute in the html tag:

    <html lang="es-US">

Other languages will be supported as needed, but the using site will need to load the appropriate strings into a global array used by electro-privacy:

    /**
    * Add language support to electro-privacy module
    *   This code needs to be executed before importing
        electro-privacy
    */

    window.ElectroPrivacyLanguageMap = {
    'zz-US': require('../../..
      /node_modules/electro-privacy/dist/lang/zz-US.json'),
    };

NOE: This needs to be setup before electro-privacy is included by the client. The mapping needs to the lang value for the html tag for the site.

## Publishing a new version

- Update the version number in package.json
- Commit, tag (e.g. git tag v1.2.3), push, and push tags
- (one time only) Generate a token in GitHub that has write:packages in scope. [Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
- (one time only) Create a .npmrc file in your user root directory:

//npm.pkg.github.com/:\_authToken={your write-packages token here}
@electro-creative-workshop:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/

- From the root directory of this repository, run:

```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```
